                <h1>School of Code</h1>
                <p>I have very recently completed an intense 16 week long coding boot camp with the School of Code (cohort 12) and learned so many technologies and skills that I will happily take into my career going forwards. My current tech stack is the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) stack although I am happy to learn new languages as and when needed.</p>
                <p>With no experience coding prior to the boot camp I was drawn to the tech industry as not only can you build projects from the ground up but you can do so in a stable career, so when the chance to join School of Code for free came up I jumped at the chance.</p>
