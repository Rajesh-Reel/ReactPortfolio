                <h1>School of Code Bootcamp 12</h1>
                <p>I have very recently completed an intense 16 week long coding boot camp with the School of Code (cohort 12) and learned so many technologies and skills that I will happily take into my career going forwards. My current tech stack is the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) stack although I am happy to learn new languages as and when needed.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>With no experience coding prior to the boot camp I was drawn to the tech industry as not only can you build projects from the ground up but you can do so in a stable industry, I am very thankful for my experience during the boot camp as I got to build full stack applications with a variety of people from diverse backgrounds.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>My previous career for a number of years was in the pharmaceutical industry and the reason for the career change was the lack of progression, so when a space was available at School of Code - for FREE - I jumped at the chance. Now I really look forward to succeeding and learning further in my new career.</p>
